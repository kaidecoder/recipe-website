    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Traditional Jamaican curry is made with scotch bonnet peppers and Jamaican curry powder.

        It’s a bold, flavorful dish that’s cooked slowly over low heat, allowing time for the spices to develop.
        It contains pieces of juicy chicken (usually thighs), along with carrots and potatoes. The potatoes break down a little and help thicken the broth.
        Its bright yellow color comes from Jamaican curry powder.
        Scotch bonnet peppers give it a sweet, fruity heat.
        It’s believed that the dish (and its corresponding spices) came to Jamaica in the 17th century when workers from East India were brought to the British colony.</p>
